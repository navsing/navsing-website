## 🧠 Background

Before product leadership, I built systems at the edge of physics and distributed computing.

- Built networks designed to survive deep oceans  
- Reimagined caching architectures assuming unlimited home-router storage  
- Designed real-time systems scanning the night sky for rare cosmic events  

My work lives where:  
- Distributed systems meet physics  
- Bandwidth is scarce  
- Latency is brutal  
- Sometimes the dataset is the universe
